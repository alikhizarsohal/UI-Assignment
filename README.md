# UI Training Assignment - Pixel Perfect Design

This repository contains the source code for my UI assignment, completed during the first week of my internship at **Devsinc**. The project was based on a Figma design provided by the team and developed using **HTML** and **CSS** to achieve a pixel-perfect match with the design specifications.

## Project Overview

The objective of this assignment was to accurately replicate the provided Figma design as part of my first week's UI training. This task helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- Structuring HTML layouts.
- Styling with CSS for pixel-perfect accuracy.
- Understanding and implementing design specifications.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS** - For styling and layout to match the provided Figma design.
